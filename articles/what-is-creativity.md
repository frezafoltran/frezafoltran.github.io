Is creativity the permission to be imperfect?

Creativity is a process of trial and error.

It involves starting down paths that may be wrong and staying on them long enough to learn why.

These detours are not mistakes, they are how exploration and innovation happens.

He never had a bad meal.

But he also never discovered the truly ass slapping ones.
