Maybe we are all artists, but only those out of their shells are labeled as such.

What do artists do? I'd say they create things that cause emotions.

I think remarkable artists create things that trigger specific emotions very intensely.

Could frame an artists work as a window into what they feel.

And not everyone wants to share feelings publicly.
